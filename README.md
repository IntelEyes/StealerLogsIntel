üß© Project Overview
> StealerLogIntel is a threat intelligence automation project aimed at collecting, processing, correlating, and analyzing logs generated by stealer malware families such as Lumma Stealer, RedLine, Meta Stealer, and others. The ultimate goal is to transform raw stealer logs into actionable intelligence that can be shared with CERTs, CSIRTs, SOCs, and other cybersecurity authorities, protecting critical infrastructures and organizations worldwide.

üîç Key Features
* Multi-source Log Collection: Crawling and scraping stealer logs from public and underground sources
* Data Enrichment: Extract metadata such as system info, geolocation, process lists, IP addresses, and domain references
* Credential & Session Intelligence: Identify compromised accounts and services (e.g., email, banking, cloud)
* Threat Actor Correlation: Map logs to known campaigns or groups using TTPs and MITRE ATT&CK
* Export Intelligence: Generate JSON, CSV, PDF, and STIX 2.1 feeds
* CERT/SOC Integration: Tailored outputs for sharing with trusted security partners

üß™ Sample Intelligence Use Cases
* Notifying CERT of a stealer compromise in national infrastructure
* Identifying leaked credentials targeting financial institutions
* Tracking an ongoing stealer campaign and its infrastructure
* Correlating logs to leaked RDP or cloud access for ransomware operations
